# Cursor Configuration

This directory contains Cursor IDE configuration files for the project.

## Files

- `settings.json` - Cursor-specific settings that override user/workspace settings
- `rules/` - Custom rules and configurations for Cursor

## Development

These settings are designed to work alongside the existing VS Code configuration while providing a consistent experience in Cursor. The settings are synchronized with the project's `.vscode/settings.json` where possible.

## Custom Rules

Custom rules for Cursor can be added to the `rules/` directory. These rules can help enforce project-specific coding standards and practices.

## Integration with Windsurf

This configuration is designed to work alongside the Windsurf environment. Any changes to the development workflow should be reflected in both Cursor and Windsurf configurations.
