# ProcessWire Template Stubs

## Details about templates and fields

Details about existing templates and fields in them are stored in template stubs.
The template stubs are auto-generated and located in: `/site/templates/AutoTemplateStubs/`.
Whenever there is a task containing template work and field logic the folder contains details about available templates and fields.
