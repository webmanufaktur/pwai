# 03 - Backlog Grooming

## Purpose
Regularly review and prioritize tasks in the backlog to maintain a healthy workflow.

## Steps

1. **Review Backlog**
   - Check `tasks/backlog/` for all pending tasks
   - Look for stale or outdated tasks
   - Verify task dependencies

2. **Prioritize**
   - Sort tasks by priority (P0, P1, P2)
   - Consider business value and dependencies
   - Balance quick wins vs. large efforts

3. **Refine Tasks**
   - Break down large tasks (> 8 points)
   - Clarify ambiguous requirements
   - Update task status and descriptions

4. **Plan Next Sprint**
   - Move high-priority tasks to `tasks/active/`
   - Ensure balanced workload
   - Consider team capacity

## Outputs
- Prioritized backlog
- Clear next steps for implementation
- Updated task statuses
